# MemoryGame

## A simple browser-based memory game built with React and Tailwind CSS. 

If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match. 
Each turn: 
* The player flips two cards over to reveal their underlying symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards don't match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
  
The Deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards. Each pair of cards has a different symbol on the front. The board consists of those pairds arranged randomly in a grid.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
